Server Patches
==============

Each server patch describes the patch that updates the previous version to the new version on the server.

This is done so that the maintainer doesn't have to transfer all the files to the server, just the ones that are needed.

As usual the mods directory is not versioned, and instead a snapshot of the manifest at that release is versioned.
