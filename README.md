This is a modpack.

Directory Structure
-------------------

The files are divided up into the following directories,

 - `src/` contains the scripts and tools I use to maintain the manifest file, and build the mod
 - `modpack/` contains the configuration of the modpack itself, including configs generated by running the game and zenscript scripts for craft-tweaker

Getting Started
---------------

Clone this repo, then create a folder called `static/` at the root. Download the _latest_ forge installer (which you can find [here][0]). Run the installer from anywhere in your file system, selecting the _server_ option from the available options. Install the server in the `static/` directory.

Later, when you run the build script, the files in static will be copied into the build directory.
